# feathers-chat-sequelize

Failed attempt at making https://github.com/pedrogk/feathers-chat-sequelize/issues work on Ubuntu 20.10 Node.js v14.16.0.

After these patches, the database is created, and user entries are added. But login still fails. Presumably the previous sequelize was not compatible with the newer PostgreSQL.
